When to Apply Two Pointers:

Assume there is a "good segment" we have to find longest , shotest, number of ... etc "good segment" then.

1. First let there is a good segment l-r then if we have segment l` - r` such that it is also good, whether it is inside
or outside the l-r then we can consider TWO-Pointers

and

2. (Notic that we have to `add`, `remove` and `check the goodness` of the segment) so if it is possible to 
 do this kind of stuff then only we can consider TWO-Pointers


Applying  Both Checks We can solve the question using Two-Pointers
